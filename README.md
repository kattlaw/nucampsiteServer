Nucamp Server

This project was done as a workshop during the Back-End course of NuCamp Full Stack Web and Mobile Development. Integrated the use of mongoDB, Express, and Node to simulate a server-side application. 

Some highlights of the application include:
- REST API Endpoints in Express Server application
- Use of MongoDB database with Mongoose ODM library for Schema and Model for a collection of documents
- Interacting with the database through the Express server
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
